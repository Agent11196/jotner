## Description

This is a small lightweight magnifying/zooming application for [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) written in the 
[C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
This is HEAVILY inspired by [boomer](https://github.com/tsoding/boomer), but is made to be faster, smaller and has no issues with WM animations
